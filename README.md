# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge



## Overview 
Create a machine learning model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale.

The Ames Housing Dataset is contains over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.

## Problem Statement

The city of Ames is a relatively small town in the state of Iowa, with a population of approximately 66,000.

Ames is also the home of Iowa State University (ISU), a large public university, whose 33,000 students make up half of the town's population. With the university being such an integral part of the society in Ames, would the real estate value be relatively higher in neighborhoods that are closer to the school campus?

Would a new faculty member moving to the area, or any new Ames resident, expect to have to pay a premium to live close to the university.

Let's set our null hypothesis to:

Null Hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>:
Properties located in the neighborhoods have a 5% relative sales price.


Althernative Hypothesis $H_A$: Prices in the six neighborhoods closest to Iowa State do not have a 5% higher price premium.




approximately 66,000, which includes

## Submission

## Presentation Structure

- **Must be within time limit established by local instructor.**
- Use Google Slides or some other presentation system (Keynote, Powerpoint, etc).
- Consider your audience. 
- Start with the **problem** you are solving.
- Use visuals that are appropriately scaled and interpretable.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level).
- Talk about your primary findings.
- Make sure you provide **clear recommendations** that follow logically from your analyses and narrative and answer your data science problem.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.

### The Data Science Process

**Problem Statement**
- Is it clear?
- Is it reasonable?
- Is the audience clearly identified?

**Data Cleaning and EDA**
- Are missing values dealt with?
- Are important distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are possible modeling insights to investigate discussed?

**Preprocessing and Modeling**
- Are categorical variables one-hot encoded or encoded in another logical way?
- Are features engineered?
- Have the data been scaled appropriately?
- Does the student properly split the data for validation/training purposes?
- Does the student use feature selection to remove noisy or multi-collinear features?
- Does the student test and evaluate a variety of model types (**AT MINIMUM:** linear regression, lasso, and ridge)?
- Does the student defend their choice of the best model for this data and problem statement?
- Does the student explain how the model works and evaluate its performance successes/downfalls?

**Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding**
- Does the student accurately identify and explain the baseline score?
- Does the student select and use metrics relevant to the problem statement?
- Is more than one metric uses to better assess performance?
- Does the student correctly interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference?

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- Are the conclusions/recommendations clearly stated?
- Does the conclusion answer the original problem statement?
- Is it clear how the final recommendations were reached? Do they follow logically?
- Does the student address how their suggestions will likely benefit stakeholders?
- Are future steps to move the project forward identified?

### Organization and Professionalism

**Project Organization**
- Are modules imported correctly (using appropriate aliases)?
- Are data imported/saved using relative paths (so someone can replicate your analysis)?
- Does the README provide a good executive summary of the project?
- Is Markdown formatting and comments used appropriately to communicate in the notebooks?
- Are files & directories organized?
- Are unnecessary files included?
- Do files and directories have well-structured, appropriate, consistent names?

**Visualizations**
- Are sufficient helpful visualizations provided?
- Are plots labeled properly?
- Are plots interpreted appropriately?
- Are plots formatted and scaled appropriately for inclusion in a notebook-based technical report?

**Python Syntax and Control Flow**
- Is care taken to write human readable code?
- Is the code syntactically correct (no runtime errors)?
- Does the code generate desired results (logically correct)?
- Does the code follow general best practices?

**Presentation**
- Is the problem statement clearly presented?
- Does the body of the presentation building address the problem statement and lead to the conclusion?
- Is the conclusion/recommendations clearly stated?
- Is the level of technicality appropriate for the intended audience?
- Does the student deliver their message clearly?
- Are appropriate visualizations generated for the intended audience?
- Are visualizations useful for supporting conclusions/explaining findings?

In order to pass the project, students must earn a minimum score of 1 for each category.
- Earning below a 1 in one or more of the above categories would result in a failing project.
- While a minimum of 1 in each category is the required threshold for graduation, students should aim to earn at least an average of 1.5 across each category. An average score below 1.5, while it may be passing, means students may want to solicit specific feedback in order to significantly improve the project before showcasing it as part of a portfolio or the job search.

### REMEMBER:

This is a learning environment and you are encouraged to try new things, even if they don't work out as well as you planned! While this rubric outlines what we look for in a _good_ project, it is up to you to go above and beyond to create a _great_ project. **Learn from your failures and you'll grow!**
